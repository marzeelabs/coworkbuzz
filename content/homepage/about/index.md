**Cowork Buzz** was born in 2016 as an **event dedicated to cowork and coliving**, curated with a special touch. Since the buzz is really huge, we are here to stay and continue bringing the coworking ecosystem forward.

\
**This year it will take place on 25th and 26th of October** so it’s just around the corner! The motto of this edition is **“Unique is the new black”**. With more and more spaces popping up on the market it’s important to know how to stay You. And it’s not only about being different and having an outstanding concept, but it’s about the ability to push the limits existing in our head. 

\
So, we want this edition to be special. Portugal’s potential in the collaborative space industry has grown rapidly and Cowork Buzz is here to bring together the main stakeholders who play a significant role in impacting this growth. As main goals for this conference, we want to show you how you can be and think "Out of the box", bring some non-coworking hands-on workshops on "The mechanisms of growth", and have the industry come together once again. 

This year we count with managers of coworking spaces, founders, community managers, people interested in developing a project related to this field, space design innovation companies, real estate groups and students interested in the subject. Let’s help each other to understand where are we standing, what are the trends, common difficulties, strengths, and **unite and grow.**

> **Early Birds tickets are on sale until 31st of August of 2019. **
