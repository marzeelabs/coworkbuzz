**Cowork Buzz** was born in 2016 as an **event dedicated to cowork and coliving**, curated with a special touch. Since the buzz is really huge, we are here to stay and continue bringing the coworking ecosystem forward.

Our main idea is to bring the community together: coworking managers, founders, community managers, people interested in developing a project related to this area. Let's help each other to understand where are we standing, what are the trends, common difficulties, strengths, and **unite and grow**.

This year it will take place in the 19th and 20th of October, it’s just around the corner! So [**grab a ticket!**](http://events.eventzilla.net/e/cowork-buzz-2018-2138948931)
